The CSS code block below technically has a syntax error (a missing `}`).

```css
body {
  ...
  ... add a closing brace here to see the highlight difference in line 14
```

However, syntax errors should not spill into subsequent blocks. The block below should be highlighted properly as JavaScript.

```js
if ('string') {  // 'string' should be red
  ...
```
